# Option 1: Computer Account Authentication - Complete Explanation

## 📋 **What Is This Approach?**

Instead of using a gMSA account directly, the Windows client authenticates to Vault using its **computer account** (the machine's identity in Active Directory), while the gMSA is used on the Vault server for keytab validation.

---

## 🔄 **How It Works:**

### **Current Problem (Why Authentication Fails):**

```
Windows Client:
├── Scheduled Task runs as: vault-gmsa$
├── Obtains Kerberos ticket for: vault-gmsa$ @ LOCAL.LAB
└── SPNEGO token contains: vault-gmsa$ credentials

Vault Server:
├── Has keytab for: vault-keytab-svc (different account!)
├── Tries to validate: vault-gmsa$ ticket
└── ❌ FAILS: Keytab password doesn't match gMSA password
```

**Result**: `0x80090308` SEC_E_UNKNOWN_CREDENTIALS

---

### **Option 1 Solution (Computer Account):**

```
Windows Client:
├── Scheduled Task runs as: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
├── SYSTEM uses: Computer Account (EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$)
├── Obtains Kerberos ticket for: EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$ @ LOCAL.LAB
└── SPNEGO token contains: Computer account credentials

Vault Server:
├── Has keytab for: EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$ (computer account)
├── Validates: EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$ ticket
└── ✅ SUCCESS: Keytab matches computer account password
```

**Result**: Authentication works!

---

## ✅ **Pros (Advantages):**

### **1. 100% Passwordless**
- ✅ No passwords stored anywhere
- ✅ No password in scheduled task
- ✅ SYSTEM account runs the task
- ✅ Computer account password is managed by Active Directory

### **2. Automatic Password Rotation**
- ✅ Computer account password auto-rotates every 30 days (AD managed)
- ✅ Keytab doesn't expire (static on Vault)
- ✅ No keytab rotation needed!

**Why keytab doesn't expire:**
- The Vault server doesn't change the computer account's password
- Only the client (Windows) changes its own password
- Vault just validates using the keytab (read-only operation)
- The keytab stays valid indefinitely

### **3. Microsoft Recommended**
- ✅ Official approach for Windows service authentication
- ✅ Used by Windows services like IIS, SQL Server, etc.
- ✅ Well-documented and supported

### **4. Security Benefits**
- ✅ Computer account has lower privileges than user accounts
- ✅ Can't be used for interactive logon
- ✅ Tied to specific machine (can't be moved)
- ✅ Automatically disabled if computer leaves domain

### **5. Simplicity**
- ✅ No gMSA creation required
- ✅ No special AD groups needed
- ✅ No `PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword` configuration
- ✅ Computer account already exists

### **6. Production Ready**
- ✅ Zero maintenance required
- ✅ No manual keytab updates
- ✅ Survives computer reboots
- ✅ Survives AD password rotation

## ❌ **Cons (Disadvantages):**

### **1. Computer-Specific**
- ❌ Keytab is tied to ONE specific computer
- ❌ Can't share keytab across multiple Windows clients
- ❌ Each computer needs its own keytab on Vault

**Impact**: 
- If you have 10 Windows servers, you need 10 keytabs
- Each keytab is ~500 bytes, so not a storage issue
- Vault configuration becomes per-computer, not per-role

### **2. SPN Registration Limitation**
- ❌ SPN can only be registered to ONE account at a time
- ❌ `HTTP/vault.local.lab` can be on gMSA OR computer account, not both

**Current situation:**
```powershell
# SPN is currently on vault-gmsa
setspn -L vault-gmsa
# Shows: HTTP/vault.local.lab
```

**Would need to change to:**
```powershell
# Move SPN to computer account
setspn -D HTTP/vault.local.lab vault-gmsa
setspn -A HTTP/vault.local.lab EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$
```

**Impact**:
- Can only use ONE authentication method at a time
- Can't have some clients use gMSA and others use computer account
- Switching between methods requires SPN re-registration

### **3. Computer Rename Issues**
- ❌ If computer is renamed, SPN and keytab must be regenerated
- ❌ Computer account name changes with hostname

**Impact**:
- Rare occurrence (servers don't get renamed often)
- Easy to fix (re-generate keytab)
- Can be mitigated with proper naming conventions

### **4. Less Intuitive**
- ❌ "gMSA" in the name but not using gMSA for client auth
- ❌ More complex to explain to team members
- ❌ Documentation needs to be clear

**Impact**:
- Confusion during onboarding
- Requires good documentation
- Not a technical limitation, just conceptual

### **5. Domain Controller Dependency**
- ❌ Computer must stay domain-joined
- ❌ If computer leaves domain, authentication breaks

**Impact**:
- Same as with gMSA, so not really a "con" compared to current approach
- Standard requirement for AD-based authentication

## 📊 **Comparison Table:**

| Feature | gMSA Client Auth (Current) | Computer Account (Option 1) |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Passwordless** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Auto Password Rotation** | ✅ Client: Yes, ❌ Server: Manual | ✅ Client: Yes, ✅ Server: N/A |
| **Keytab Maintenance** | ❌ Must sync every 30 days | ✅ Zero maintenance |
| **Multi-Client Support** | ✅ Same gMSA for all | ❌ Unique per computer |
| **SPN Flexibility** | ✅ Easy to share | ❌ One computer at a time |
| **Setup Complexity** | ❌ High (gMSA + groups) | ✅ Low (already exists) |
| **Current Status** | ❌ **BROKEN** (keytab mismatch) | ⚠️ Not implemented |
| **Microsoft Support** | ⚠️ Limited for SPNEGO | ✅ Full support |

## 🔧 **Implementation Details:**

### **What Changes Are Needed:**

#### **1. On Windows Client:**

```powershell
# Change scheduled task to run as SYSTEM
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal `
    -UserId "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" `
    -LogonType ServiceAccount `
    -RunLevel Highest

Set-ScheduledTask -TaskName "VaultClientApp" -Principal $principal
```

**Effect**: Task now runs as SYSTEM, which uses the computer account for Kerberos

#### **2. On Active Directory (Domain Controller):**

```powershell
# Move SPN from gMSA to computer account
setspn -D HTTP/vault.local.lab vault-gmsa
setspn -A HTTP/vault.local.lab EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$

# Verify
setspn -L EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$
# Should show: HTTP/vault.local.lab
```

**Effect**: Computer account can now request service tickets for the SPN

#### **3. Generate Keytab for Computer Account:**

```powershell
# On Domain Controller
ktpass -princ HTTP/vault.local.lab@LOCAL.LAB `
    -mapuser LOCAL\EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL$ `
    -crypto AES256-SHA1 `
    -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL `
    -pass "CURRENT_COMPUTER_PASSWORD" `
    -out computer.keytab

# Convert to base64
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("computer.keytab")) | Out-File computer.keytab.b64
```

**Challenge**: Getting the computer account password
- Option A: Reset it with `ktpass` (will break other services!)
- Option B: Extract from AD (requires special tools/permissions)
- Option C: Let Windows manage it, just use existing keytab rotation

#### **4. On Vault Server:**

```bash
# Update keytab
vault write auth/gmsa/config keytab="$(cat computer.keytab.b64)"

# Note: Auto-rotation will need computer account credentials
# This is where it gets complex...
```

---

## 🤔 **The Keytab Generation Challenge:**

### **Problem:**
Computer account passwords are:
- 240 characters long
- Random complex string
- Auto-generated by Windows
- **Not accessible** to administrators by default

### **Solutions:**

#### **Option A: Reset Computer Password (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
```powershell
ktpass -princ ... -pass "NewPassword123!" -out computer.keytab
```
**Impact**: ❌ Breaks all services using computer account (domain trust!)

#### **Option B: Use Existing Password (COMPLEX)**
Requires special AD permissions and tools to read the password attribute

#### **Option C: Static Keytab + Manual Rotation (SIMPLE)**
- Generate keytab once
- Use for 30 days
- Before expiry, manually generate new keytab
- This is what Vault auto-rotation was meant to solve!

## 💡 **Alternative Hybrid Approach:**

### **What if we combine the best of both?**

```
Windows Client:
├── Scheduled Task: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (computer account)
├── SPNEGO Token: Computer account credentials
└── Passwordless: ✅

Vault Server:
├── Static gMSA: vault-gmsa (never retrieves password)
├── Keytab: Generated once for gMSA
├── Password: Never rotates (no Windows computer assigned)
└── Validates: gMSA tickets from... wait, this doesn't work!
```

**Problem**: If client uses computer account, Vault must validate computer account, not gMSA!

---

## 🎯 **Recommendation Analysis:**

### **When Option 1 (Computer Account) Is BEST:**

✅ **Use Computer Account If:**
- Single Windows client (or few clients)
- Production environment requiring zero maintenance
- You can handle keytab generation complexity
- You don't need to share authentication across multiple servers

### **When Option 1 Is NOT BEST:**

❌ **Don't Use Computer Account If:**
- Multiple Windows clients need same authentication
- Frequent computer renames or replacements
- Need simpler keytab generation process
- Want to use gMSA features (shared identity)

---

## 🔄 **Alternative: Fix Current gMSA Approach**

Instead of switching to computer account, we could:

### **Option 2: Generate gMSA Keytab Properly**

**The Challenge:**
- `ktpass` with gMSA answers 'n' to password change (correct!)
- But then doesn't create keytab (limitation!)

**The Solution:**
- Use a **static gMSA** (not assigned to any computers)
- This gMSA's password never rotates
- Generate keytab with `ktpass` (answer 'y' to set password)
- Client still uses regular gMSA with rotation
- Vault validates using static gMSA keytab

**But wait...** this has same problem - client gMSA ≠ server gMSA!

---

## 📝 **Summary:**

### **Option 1 (Computer Account) Pros:**
1. ✅ 100% passwordless
2. ✅ Auto password rotation
3. ✅ **No keytab rotation needed**
4. ✅ Microsoft recommended
5. ✅ Production ready

### **Option 1 (Computer Account) Cons:**
1. ❌ One keytab per computer
2. ❌ SPN can only be on one account
3. ❌ Computer rename breaks it
4. ❌ **Keytab generation is complex**

### **The Real Question:**

**Is the benefit of "zero keytab maintenance" worth the complexity of initial keytab generation?**

- If YES → Use Computer Account (Option 1)
- If NO → Fix the current gMSA keytab mismatch with a proper gMSA keytab

---

## 🚀 **My Honest Recommendation:**

For your specific case (single Windows client, production environment), I recommend:

### **Hybrid Approach:**

1. **Fix Current Issue First** (Quick Win):
   - Generate proper keytab for `vault-gmsa`
   - Update Vault server
   - Test authentication
   - **Result**: Working authentication in 10 minutes

2. **Then Evaluate Long-Term** (Optional):
   - Monitor keytab expiration (30 days)
   - If manual rotation is acceptable: Keep gMSA
   - If zero-touch is required: Switch to computer account

**Why This Order?**
- Gets you working NOW
- Gives time to evaluate maintenance burden
- Allows informed decision based on actual usage
- No commitment to complex computer account setup
