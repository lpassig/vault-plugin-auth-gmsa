## ðŸ§ª **Test Authentication on Windows Client**

**On EC2AMAZ-UB1QVDL** (Windows client), run:

```powershell
# Trigger the scheduled task
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'VaultClientApp'

# Wait for completion
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# Check logs
Get-Content 'C:\vault-client\config\vault-client.log' -Tail 30
```

## âœ… **Expected SUCCESS Output**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Should Happen**

1. âœ… **No more 0x80090308 error** - Keytab matches gMSA password
2. âœ… **SPNEGO token generated successfully** - Real Kerberos token created
3. âœ… **Vault authentication successful** - Token validated by Vault
4. âœ… **Secrets retrieved** - Dynamic credentials fetched

---

## ðŸ”§ **If It Still Fails**

Share the **exact error** from the logs and we'll debug further.

But this **should work now!** The keytab was freshly generated from the current gMSA password and successfully uploaded to Vault. ðŸš€
